- **Harvest Scheduling**: Detailed scheduling with priority management and resource allocation
- **Harvest Recording**: Real-time harvest data capture with yield and quality tracking
- **Loss Tracking**: Comprehensive tracking of harvest losses with categorization
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Advanced analytics with yield analysis and performance metrics

### Key Capabilities
- Multi-farm support with role-based access control
- Integration with existing farm, field, and crop data
- Real-time dashboard with summary metrics
- Priority-based harvest scheduling
- Quality grading system (Grade1, Grade2, Grade3, Rejected)
- Multiple yield unit support (Kilograms, Tonnes, Bags, Boxes, Crates)
- Loss categorization (Weather, Pests, Disease, Equipment, Human, Other)

## Architecture

### Database Schema

The system introduces four core database tables:

#### HarvestPlan
- Seasonal harvest planning at farm level
- Status tracking (Draft, Active, Completed, Cancelled)
- Date range management with notes

#### HarvestSchedule
- Field-crop specific scheduling
- Priority management (Low, Medium, High, Urgent)
- Estimated yield and resource requirements
- Status tracking (Planned, InProgress, Completed, Cancelled, Postponed)

#### HarvestRecord
- Actual harvest data capture
- Yield tracking with quality assessment
- Weather conditions and notes
- Labor and equipment tracking

#### HarvestLoss
- Loss tracking with categorization
- Quantity and estimated value capture
- Detailed descriptions and photos support

### Enumerations

Six new enumerations support the harvest management workflow:

- `HarvestPlanStatus`: Plan lifecycle management
- `HarvestStatus`: Schedule and record status tracking
- `HarvestPriority`: Priority-based scheduling
- `QualityGrade`: Harvest quality assessment
- `YieldUnit`: Flexible yield measurement
- `HarvestLossType`: Loss categorization

### Service Layer

The `HarvestService` provides comprehensive business logic with 25+ methods including:

**Plan Management**
- `CreateHarvestPlanAsync()`: Create seasonal plans
- `UpdateHarvestPlanAsync()`: Update existing plans
- `GetHarvestPlansByFarmAsync()`: Retrieve farm-specific plans
- `DeleteHarvestPlanAsync()`: Soft delete plans

**Schedule Management**
- `CreateHarvestScheduleAsync()`: Schedule field harvests
- `GetUpcomingHarvestsAsync()`: Priority-based upcoming harvests
- `GetHarvestSchedulesByPlanAsync()`: Plan-specific schedules
- `UpdateScheduleStatusAsync()`: Status management

**Record Management**
- `CreateHarvestRecordAsync()`: Capture harvest data
- `GetHarvestRecordsByScheduleAsync()`: Schedule-specific records
- `GetHarvestRecordsByDateRangeAsync()`: Date-filtered records

**Loss Management**
- `CreateHarvestLossAsync()`: Record harvest losses
- `GetHarvestLossesByRecordAsync()`: Record-specific losses
- `GetLossAnalyticsAsync()`: Loss trend analysis

**Analytics**
- `GetYieldAnalyticsAsync()`: Comprehensive yield analysis
- `GetHarvestSummaryAsync()`: Dashboard summary data
- `GetHarvestTrendsAsync()`: Historical trend analysis

### API Endpoints

The `HarvestController` exposes 20+ REST endpoints organized into logical sections:

**Harvest Plans** (`/harvest/plans`)
- `GET /`: List harvest plans
- `GET /{id}`: Get specific plan
- `POST /`: Create new plan

**Harvest Schedules** (`/harvest/schedules`)
- `GET /`: List schedules with filtering
- `GET /{id}`: Get specific schedule
- `POST /`: Create new schedule
- `PUT /{id}`: Update schedule
- `GET /upcoming`: Get upcoming harvests
- `PUT /{id}/status`: Update schedule status

**Harvest Records** (`/harvest/records`)
- `GET /`: List harvest records
- `GET /{id}`: Get specific record
- `POST /`: Create harvest record
- `PUT /{id}`: Update record
- `GET /schedule/{scheduleId}`: Get records by schedule

**Harvest Losses** (`/harvest/losses`)
- `GET /`: List harvest losses
- `POST /`: Create loss record
- `GET /record/{recordId}`: Get losses by record

**Analytics** (`/harvest/analytics`)
- `GET /yield`: Yield analytics
- `GET /summary`: Dashboard summary
- `GET /trends`: Historical trends
- `GET /losses`: Loss analytics

### User Interface

The system provides four main UI components:

#### Harvest Dashboard (`/harvest`)
- Summary cards showing key metrics
- Recent harvest activity timeline
- Quick access to all harvest functions
- Farm-specific data filtering

#### Harvest Planning (`/harvest/planning`)
- Seasonal harvest plan creation and management
- Plan status tracking and updates
- Integration with existing farm and crop data
- Bulk operations support

#### Harvest Schedule (`/harvest/schedule`)
- Detailed harvest scheduling interface
- Priority-based task management
- Field-crop selection with visual previews
- Resource requirement planning

#### Harvest Record (`/harvest/record`)
- Real-time harvest data capture
- Quality assessment tools
- Yield tracking and measurement
- Loss recording capabilities

#### Harvest Analytics (`/harvest/analytics`)
- Comprehensive reporting dashboard
- Interactive charts and graphs
- Date range filtering
- Farm comparison tools
- Export capabilities

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
- **AutoMapper 12.0.1**: Object-object mapping
- **Entity Framework Core**: Database access
- **Syncfusion Blazor**: UI components
- **ASP.NET Core 8.0**: Web API framework

### Database Migration
Migration `AddHarvestManagementTables` was successfully created and applied, adding:
- Four new tables with proper relationships
- Foreign key constraints to existing entities
- Audit fields for tracking changes
- Indexes for performance optimization

### Security & Access Control
- Role-based access control integration
- Farm-specific data filtering
- Permission-based UI rendering
- Secure API endpoint protection

### Performance Considerations
