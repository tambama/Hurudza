### MODULE 8: Real Data Entry Practice (30 minutes)
**Time:** 4:00 - 4:30 PM

#### Learning Objectives
- Apply all learned skills with actual data
- Enter historical data
- Identify data migration challenges
- Build confidence for independent use

#### Lesson Plan

**4:00 - 4:05: Introduction (5 min)**

**Explain Activity:**
"Now it's time to work with your actual farm data. This is where learning becomes real!"

**Objectives:**
- Enter real data from your records
- Practice all skills learned today
- Identify any issues or challenges
- Get comfortable with realistic scenarios

**What You'll Do:**
1. Bring out your existing farm records
2. Enter data into BGF-AMS

5. Assign actual crops
6. Trainer and peers will help

**Trainer Note:** This is most valuable part. Real practice, real value.

---

**4:05 - 4:25: Guided Real Data Entry (20 min)**

**Scenario-Based Practice:**

**Scenario 1: Creating Actual Fields (if needed)**
If they haven't created real fields yet:
1. Use their farm maps/records
2. Create fields with actual names
3. Enter accurate sizes
4. Record actual soil types
5. Set correct status

**Scenario 2: Recording Historical Tillage**
If they have recent tillage records:
1. Create/use existing program
2. Record actual services performed
3. Enter accurate dates
4. Real hectares tilled
5. Actual equipment used
